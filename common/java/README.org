#+TITLE: The AIDDL Common Java Library

To install run the following command in this folder (omit './' under Windows):

#+begin_example
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
#+end_example

This will compile and install the java common library in the local Maven
repository. This will allow other projects to depend on it. To add the common
library to a gradle project, add the following implementation block to the
dependencies in your /build.gradle/ (modify version numbers as needed):

#+begin_example
dependencies {
    implementation("org.aiddl.common:aiddl-common") {
        version {
            strictly("[2.0.0, 3.0.0[")
        }
    }
}
#+end_example
