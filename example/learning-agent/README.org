#+TITLE: Learning Agent

This project contains two examples that combine automated planning and machine
learning. 

* Learning for Planning

In this example the planner has an incomplete domain (no operators). A set of
actions can be executed but their conditions and effects are unknown. If no plan
can be found, an experimentation module chooses a random action.  Otherwise, the
next action of the current plan is executed. In either case, the outcome of
executing the action is recorded as a data point. A decision tree learner is
used to learn preconditions and effects of actions. The resulting decision tree
is then converted to operators. This example is illustrated in the flow chart
below.

To run this example use
Open a terminal in the java folder and run:

#+begin_src sh
./run-planning-for-learning.sh # Linux
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src sh
run-planning-for-learning.bat # Windows
#+end_src

* Planning for Learning

In this example the automated planner is used to collect data for a machine
learning system. In the example domain a robot is tasked to go to certain
locations, fetch samples, and return them to a station. Samples are then
converted to data points. Learning with cross-validation is applied once enough
data has been collected. This loop stops when a minimum of data points and model
accuracy have been reached. This example is illustrated in the flow chart below.

To run this example use
Open a terminal in the java folder and run:

#+begin_src sh
./run-planning-for-learning.sh # Linux
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src sh
run-planning-for-learning.bat # Windows
#+end_src
