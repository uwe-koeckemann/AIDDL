#+TITLE: Planning with Resources

This is an example of white box integration. As a baseline, we use a planner
that is implemented by providing node expansion and goal test functions to a
graph search. We then integrate resources by making the following modifications:

1. Add resource assignments to the initial state.
2. Add resource changes to pick (consume) and place (produce) operators.
3. Define resource capacities (upper and lower bound).
3. Add a hood to the node expansion function to apply resource changes with
   regular state transitions.
4. Add pruning functions to the graph search that will reject states that fall
   outside of the allowed resource bound.

This example contains three domains:
- d1 :: Baseline without resources
- d2 :: Single resource for both robots
- d3 :: Individual resources and consumption/production depend on object size.

Open a terminal in this folder and run (replace <D> with one of the domain codes
shown above):

#+begin_src sh
./run.sh <D> # Linux
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src sh
run.bat <D> # Windows
#+end_src

The following figure was created automatically from the graph search request
found at the bottom of [[file:aiddl/planner.aiddl][planner.aiddl]]:
